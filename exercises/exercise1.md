# Exercise 1
03 September @ 13 - 17

## Recap of cryptography
Chapter 2 of SB reflects the material that was presented in CompSys on encryption and algorithms. We will later during the course build on this.

The TAs will shortly present the material from the book and be able to answer question relating to this.

## Start with assignments from SB 1 and SB 2
Spend time getting started on the assignment questions relating to the above:

[Assignment 1](../assignments/assignment1.md).

## Tool setup
For making the SEED labs later we will encourage you to use a virtual machine. For non-Linux users you will get the needed system, for Linux users you do not end up exposing your own machine.

We will point to the manual for CompSys for details: [CompSys VM manual](https://github.com/kirkedal/compSys-e2019-pub/tree/master/tools/vm).

You can set up your own favourite machine ([Kali](https://www.kali.org/)) for ITS, of course) or start by the image provided for CompSys.

If you have additions, corrections, or general comments to the VM manual, your are much welcome to send them to m.kirkedal@di.ku.dk.
